## Reddit Content Guidelines

### The 90/10 Rule (MANDATORY)
- **90% Community Participation**: Must contribute valuable comments, discussions, and non-promotional content
- **10% Self-Promotion**: Maximum promotional content allowed across all subreddits
- **Timing**: Space promotional posts 2-3 weeks apart in same subreddit
- **Account Requirements**: Build karma (minimum 25-50) before any promotional content

### Content Structure Requirements
- **Lead with Problems, Not Solutions**: Start with relatable user pain points or questions
- **Community Discussion Format**: Frame as "Has anyone experienced..." vs "I built..."
- **Technical Questions**: Include genuine requests for community feedback and input
- **Avoid Promotional Language**: Eliminate "First", "Enhancement", "Game-changing", "Revolutionary"

### Spam Filter Avoidance
- **No Direct CTAs**: Avoid "Give it a star", "Check out my...", "Try my product"
- **Natural Mentions**: Reference solutions organically within technical discussions
- **Question-Based Titles**: Use "How do you..." or "Anyone solved..." formats
- **Community Value**: Every post must benefit community members, not just promote

### Reddit Formatting Standards
- **Headers**: Use `**Bold Text**` instead of `# Markdown Headers` (better display)
- **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks ``` for code examples
- **Links**: Standard `[text](url)` format
- **Lists**: Use `-` or `1.` for bullet/numbered lists

## Twitter/X Content Guidelines

### The 80/20 Content Rule (MANDATORY)
- **80% Value Content**: Educational, entertaining, or insightful posts
- **20% Promotional**: Direct product mentions or calls-to-action
- **Daily Ratio**: If posting 5 times daily, only 1 can be promotional

### Content Optimization
- **Character Limits**: 280 characters maximum, brevity increases engagement
- **Thread Strategy**: Use for longer content, maintain narrative flow between tweets
- **Visual Priority**: Video content generates 1200% more shares than text
- **Hashtag Usage**: Limit to 1-2 relevant hashtags maximum

### Thread Formatting Best Practices
- **Hook Tweet**: Strong opening that promises value within first 280 characters
- **Numbered Threads**: Use 1/, 2/, 3/ for easy following
- **Value Density**: Each tweet should provide standalone value
- **CTA Placement**: Save calls-to-action for final tweet only

### Content Types That Perform
